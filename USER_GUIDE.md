## 💡 Pro Tips

*   **Switching Apps:** Don't worry if you switch to your music app or take a call. IronTrack saves your "in-progress" typing instantly. If the app refreshes, your text will still be there!
*   **Save Routines:** After you finish adding all exercises for a day, tap **"💾 Save Routine"** at the top. This way, you don't have to type the exercise names next week!
*   **Offline Mode:** Once "installed" on your home screen, the app will work even if you have poor gym Wi-Fi. It will sync your data to the cloud as soon as you are back online.
